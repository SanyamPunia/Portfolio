          , and welcome to my portfolio website! I am a fullstack web developer
          from India and I am passionate about creating web applications that
          are both functional and user-friendly.

          In my experience as a developer, I have found that simplicity is key
          to creating a great user experience. Whether it&apos;s through a clean
          and intuitive design, or by ensuring that the code behind the scenes
          is efficient and well-structured, I always strive to create web
          applications that are a pleasure to use.
